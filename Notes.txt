Issue with using yahoo-stock-api:
- works using node.js
- While using in Veet --> because of use of "require" module, browser doesnt understand. There seems to be issue from 2 side - Browser doesnt understand some of Node.js specific issues & Veet also doesnt seems to have some integration issue
- Tried Following:
(a) Import module - THrows error "Cannot call http from client:
(b) Use of browserify as per Veet portal recomm
 - Veet server goes down

(c) Tried browserify to create a bundled JS file:
- Enabled script run in Windows, but get following error

Error: Parsing file C:\Users\fiant\Desktop\FIAP\01 Software Engineering\GA\03 Projects\99 Misc\yahooLibTest\node_modules\undici\lib\fetch\headers.js: Unexpected token (405:44)



Possible Options:
